    <string name="donate_body" tools:ignore="Typos">this is an open-source project; and if you like my work,
        please do support me by donating on \"Buy Me a Coffee\" so i can afford to keep making more "great?" apps. (:\n\n
        if you don\'t wanna, it\'s cool, enjoy the app anyway!</string>

    <string name="about_body">i created this app cause i didn\'t like apps running in background and draining my phone\'s battery,
        and i had used Task Manager by Omich, Greenify and Hibernator but i didn\'t like those; also they don\'t have source code available.\n
        welp idk what else to write here, but yeah if you like this app or any of my other apps, please consider donating so i can keep
        making more (maybe even open-source) apps! (:\n\n
        oh and the libraries and their licenses are below:</string>
